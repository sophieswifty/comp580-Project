## A voice-controlled HTML5 math game
Oh no! An *evil* bug has invaded the Earth. As the Commander of the Math Troopers you have the power to control your Troopers with the sound of your voice! Guide the right Math Trooper to the Monster to Defeat it, but be warned, If you bring the wrong Math Trooper to the monster, they will not be successful. 

## Goal of the Game
Solve the equation on the right handside of the screen. Use your voice to cycle through the soldiers as each soldier represents an answer choice. Use your voice to navigate the soldier!

## How to Play
Use your voice to usher commands for each Math Trooper. You can say things like, "Red Up" or "Blue Right" to guide the Trooper through the Maze. The Monster will be running away from you, so be sure to use all your Troopers to help corner them in! You must only defeat the Monster with the Trooper who holds the right answer, or your Trooper will get seriously hurt! There is also a freeze fruit somewhere on the map. Go to it and yell "Activate" to freeze that pesky monster. 

Ready to play again or want to start over? Simply say "Reset."
