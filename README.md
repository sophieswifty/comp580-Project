## A voice-controlled HTML5 math game
Oh no! Some *evil* bugs have invaded the Earth. As the Commander of the Math Troopers you have the power to control your Troopers with the sound of your voice! Guide the right Math Trooper to the Monster to Defeat them, but be warned, If you bring the wrong Math Trooper to the monster, they will not be ready for it. 

## How to Play
Use your voice to usher commands for each Math Trooper. You can say things like, "Red Up" or "Blue Right" to guide the Trooper through the Maze. The Monster's will be running away from you, so be sure to use all your Troopers to help corner them in! You must only defeat a Monster with the right answer, or your Trooper will get seriously hurt! There is also a freeze fruit somewhere on the map. Go to it and yell "Activate" to freeze those pesky monsters.
