  # SpaceBug Math
  ## Final Report - Seth Yook, Sophie Swift, and Sofia Dimos
  
 Space Bug Math is a math game designed to engage children in an educational, accessible, and fun way to practice addition. It implements a speech-to-text function which can be used, as well as the arrow keys, to move your pawns across the board. The goal of the game is to solve the math problem presented, select the Trooper that is associated with the correct answer, and use them to defeat the Space Bug. All of the troopers, as well as a freeze element which freezes the monster for two movements, should be used to corner the space bug. In order to win, the Trooper with the correct answer must be the one to defeat the bug; the other Troopers will result in a failed attempt. 
  
  This game was created for children in elementary school in order to help them learn basic arithmetic. We are specifically hoping to target children with motor impairments, as there is no need to touch the computer to play the game with the speech-to-text feature. Deaf students could also enjoy the game given the dynamic and interactive display. There is no time element to make it easier for all children. Instead, the game keeps track of the number of steps the player takes, making an additional goal to have as little steps as possible, which can make it slightly competitive. We checked the accessibility of the game using WAVE (website accessibility evaluation tool) and incorporated alt text, header formatting, and high contrast to ensure the website meets current accessibility standards.
  
  As far as technologies go, this game was written in JavaScript and made use of HTML 5 in order to run successfully on Google Chrome. It makes use of a speech-to-text API, which players can use to move the Troopers across the board, activate the freeze element, and reset the game. There are a variety of image elements, as well as special effects, which create a stimulating experience for the players as well as the futuristic desired effect. The main technology in our code is a Web Speak API that allows us to code certain key phrases and words to move the character with our voices. We believe that this Web Speak API can have multiple uses to make certain websites accessable as well as allow gaming and education. 

  
  This game is a web-app, and in order to make this easier to build with three group members, we actively made use of git and hosted our project on GitHub. With a plugin on Visual Studio Code, we each used our own Local Ports to test the current code live and debug individually, so that our product would improve each time someone pushed the changes onto GitHub. The game is deployable with the GitHub pages link we have provided and needs to be played on Google Chrome. We have provided the full Javascript and HTML codes so another URL can host this website. We believe that the GitHub pages provides enough to be able to play and deploy it consistently with a computer and internet connection. The microphone is an important tool in order to use the speech-to-text element. 
  
  
  Our group ran into issues with adapting the template code that we found, which did not use any data structures. Restructuring the purpose and structure of the existing template code to meet our goals of creating an accessible math game required careful planning and alterations. As we moved through the process, we found ourselves having to implement our own, new arrays in order to successfully incorporate the mathematical elements. In a similar sense, we had to create, implement, and randomize a list of equations. In the future, we would likely move towards adding narration or additional sound effects to indicate to visually impaired people where they are on the board, how close they are to the Spacebug, and the like. Additionally, we would like to display the randomized answer choices on the shirts of the Troopers.
  
  Overall, we are very proud of the product we have created and genuinely hope that children find as much joy in playing Space Bug Math as we did building, testing, and running it.
